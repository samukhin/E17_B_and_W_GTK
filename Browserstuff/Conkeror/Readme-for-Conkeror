CONKEROR
create a css file starting with the line
\@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
and put css code behind it (like userChrome.css files do). Then point conkeror
to it with this line in your rc:
register_user_stylesheet('file:///path/to/file.css');


or copy the stuff in this folder to some place convenient (everything in the same folder) and call the userChrome.css in Conkeror with the above line.
